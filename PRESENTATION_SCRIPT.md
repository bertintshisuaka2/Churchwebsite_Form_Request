## Duration: 10-15 minutes

## SLIDE 1: Title Slide

**[Display: Divalaser Software Solutions logo with University of Phoenix and Georgia Tech logos]**

Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone. Thank you for joining me today. I'm excited to present our latest solution designed specifically for church website development—a comprehensive customer information collection system that streamlines the entire client onboarding process.

---

## SLIDE 2: The Challenge

**[Display: Statistics or pain points]**

Before we dive into the solution, let's talk about the challenge. When building websites for churches, we often face several obstacles:

- **Incomplete Information**: Clients often provide scattered, incomplete details across multiple emails and phone calls
- **Language Barriers**: Many churches serve multilingual congregations but lack bilingual resources
- **Time-Consuming Follow-ups**: Back-and-forth communication delays project timelines
- **Lost Opportunities**: Potential clients abandon the process due to complexity

We needed a solution that addresses all these pain points while reflecting our biblical mission.

---

## SLIDE 3: Our Mission - Matthew 24:14

**[Display: Bible verse with background]**

Our work is grounded in scripture. Matthew 24:14 tells us:

> "And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come."

This verse drives our mission: to help churches reach the ends of the earth through powerful digital presence. Every website we build is a tool for spreading the Gospel globally.

## SLIDE 4: The Solution Overview

**[Display: Application homepage screenshot]**

We've developed a comprehensive web application that transforms how we collect and manage church website requests. This isn't just a form—it's a complete customer relationship management system designed specifically for church website development.

## SLIDE 5: User Experience - The Customer Journey

**[Display: Customer form screenshot]**

Let's walk through the customer experience. When a church visits our site, they're greeted with a clean, professional interface featuring our branding and biblical foundation.

The process is simple:
1. **Click "Get Started"** - One button to begin
2. **Fill the Comprehensive Form** - Organized sections covering:
   - Church basic information
   - Contact details
   - Ministry programs
   - Website requirements
   - Budget and timeline
3. **Submit** - Instant confirmation with next steps

The form is intuitive, mobile-responsive, and available in both English and French with a simple toggle.

---

## SLIDE 6: Bilingual Capability

**[Display: Language switcher demonstration]**

One of our standout features is complete bilingual support. With a single click on the "FR" button, the entire application switches to French—including:

- All form labels and instructions
- Validation messages
- Success confirmations
- Admin dashboard interface

This ensures we can serve both English and French-speaking churches across North America and beyond, removing language as a barrier to digital ministry.

---

## SLIDE 7: Data Collection - What We Capture

**[Display: Form sections breakdown]**

Our form is comprehensive yet user-friendly, collecting:

**Church Information:**
- Name, denomination, location
- Contact details and website
- Congregation size and demographics

**Ministry Programs:**
- Worship services, children's ministry
- Youth programs, outreach initiatives
- Small groups and special events

**Website Requirements:**
- Desired features (online giving, sermon archive, event calendar)
- Design preferences
- Content management needs

**Project Details:**
- Budget range
- Timeline expectations
- Special requests

This structured approach ensures we have everything needed to provide accurate quotes and timelines.

---

## SLIDE 8: Admin Dashboard - Overview

**[Display: Admin dashboard screenshot]**

Now, let's look at the powerful admin side. After logging in with Manus OAuth and entering the secure PIN (3495), administrators access a comprehensive dashboard featuring:

**Statistics Cards:**
- Total Submissions
- Deleted Files
- Overall Activity Metrics

**Date Range Filtering:**
- Today, This Week, This Month, This Year
- Custom date ranges

**Search Functionality:**
- Instant search across all fields
- Find submissions by church name, contact, email, or location

---

## SLIDE 9: Submission Management

**[Display: Active submissions table]**

The dashboard displays all submissions in an organized table with:

- Church name and contact information
- Location details
- Submission date
- Current status (Pending, In Progress, Completed, Cancelled)
- Action buttons

Administrators can:
- **Change Status**: Update project progress with dropdown selection
- **View Details**: Access complete submission information
- **Delete to Trash**: Soft delete with PIN verification

Every action is tracked and logged for accountability.

---

## SLIDE 10: Trash System & Data Protection

**[Display: Trash tab screenshot]**

We've implemented a robust trash system to prevent accidental data loss:

**Soft Delete Process:**
1. Click delete button on any submission
2. Enter PIN (3495) to confirm
3. Submission moves to Trash tab (not permanently deleted)

**From Trash, administrators can:**
- **Restore**: Bring submission back to active list
- **Permanently Delete**: Remove forever (requires PIN + confirmation)

When permanently deleting, the system asks:
> "Are you sure you want to delete [Church Name]?"
- **Yes**: Permanently removes the submission
- **No**: Restores it to active submissions

This two-step process ensures critical data is never lost accidentally.

---

## SLIDE 11: Activity Log - Complete Accountability

**[Display: Activity Log tab screenshot]**

Transparency and accountability are crucial. Our Activity Log tracks every administrative action:

**Logged Actions:**
- Status changes (from/to what status)
- Deletions to trash
- Restorations from trash
- Permanent deletions

**Each log entry shows:**
- Action type
- Submission name
- Details of what changed
- Administrator who performed the action
- Exact timestamp

This creates a complete audit trail for compliance and accountability.

---

## SLIDE 12: Notification System

**[Display: Email notification example]**

Critical actions trigger automatic email notifications to the project owner:

**When an administrator permanently deletes a submission, you receive:**
- 🚨 Alert subject line
- Administrator's name
- Church name and contact details
- Submission ID
- Warning that action cannot be undone

This ensures oversight of all irreversible operations, even when you're not actively monitoring the dashboard.

---

## SLIDE 13: Security Features

**[Display: Security features list]**

Security is paramount when handling church data:

**Multi-Layer Protection:**
1. **OAuth Authentication**: Secure login via Manus platform
2. **Role-Based Access**: Only admin users can access dashboard
3. **PIN Verification**: 4-digit PIN (3495) required for:
   - Initial dashboard access
   - Deleting submissions to trash
   - Permanent deletions
4. **Session Management**: Automatic timeout for inactive sessions
